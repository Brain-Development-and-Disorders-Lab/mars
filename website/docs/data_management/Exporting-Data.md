# Exporting Data

Metadatify provides the capability to export data into multiple file formats.

## Exporting Entities

There are several ways to export Entities, depending on the Entity's context and desired file contents.

### Exporting Entities - Entity List

Selecting an Entity (or Entities) from the list of Entities will enable the "Export Entities" button under the yellow "Actions" menu.
