# Workspaces

Metadatify uses Workspaces to manage Entities, Projects, and Templates amongst collaborators and organizations.

## Workspace Switcher

A core component for managing Workspaces is the Workspace Switcher, located in the top left corner of the sidebar.

The Workspace Switcher displays a list of all Workspaces the user has access to. Clicking on a Workspace will switch the user to that Workspace, and the active Workspace has a green tick icon to the left of the Workspace name. The switcher has other actions including:

- **Edit workspace:** Navigates to the Workspace's settings page.
- **Create workspace:** Navigates to the Workspace creation page.
- **Account settings:** Navigates to the user's account settings page.
- **Log out:** Logs the user out of Metadatify and returns them to the login screen.

## Managing Workspaces

At least one Workspace must be created before any other actions can be performed. Typically, users will create a Workspace on their first login, unless they have been added as a collaborator to an existing Workspace.

To update the Workspace, click the "Edit workspace" action in the Workspace Switcher. This will navigate to the Workspace's settings page:

This page displays the Workspace's name, description, collaborators, Entities, and Projects. The name and description can be updated, and collaborators can be added or removed. Active Entities and Projects can be viewed, and any archived Entities and Projects can be restored.

To restore archived Entities or Projects, click the gray "Show Archived" button in the top right. The displayed Entities and Projects are currently archived and can be restored by clicking the orange "Restore" button next to the name of that Entity or Project.
