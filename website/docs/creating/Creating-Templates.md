# Creating Templates

Templates are used to create structured Attributes that can be reused across Entities.

There are three ways to create a Template Attribute using the Metadatify platform UI:

1. Use the Create Portal to begin creating a new Template. Select "Create" under the "Workspace" section of the navigation bar, and click "Create" within the Template card.
2. Directly begin creating a new Template via the "Templates" listing page. Select "Templates" under the "View" section of the navigation bar.
3. When editing an Entity and adding a new Attribute, the "Save as Template" button is shown below the Attribute input fields.

## Required Fields

**Name:** A name must be specified for each Template Attribute. The names do not have to be unique, however unique names are strongly encouraged. There are no character restrictions for names.

**Description:** A description of the Template Attribute.

**Values:** A set of values assigned to the Template Attribute. Values must be named, however they are not required to have data associated with them. In some cases, it may be useful to have pre-filled data assigned to a value.

| Value  | Data Type                                  |
| ------ | ------------------------------------------ |
| Date   | A date and timestamp                       |
| Text   | A short string of text                     |
