# Creating Projects

Projects are used to group and organize Entities.

There are two ways to create a Project using the Metadatify platform UI:

1. Use the Create Portal to begin creating a new Project. Select "Create" under the "Workspace" section of the navigation bar, and click "Create" within the Project card.
2. Directly begin creating a new Project via the "Projects" listing page. Select "Projects" under the "View" section of the navigation bar.

## Required Fields

**Name:** A name must be specified for each Project. The names do not have to be unique, however unique names are strongly encouraged. There are no character restrictions for names.

**Owner:** A Project is automatically assigned an owner, the current logged-in user.

**Description:** A description of the Project.
