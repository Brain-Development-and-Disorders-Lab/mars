# Getting Started

As you get started with Metadatify, the following information will be helpful in order to understand how to best use the platform and what it is designed to do.

## Terminology

Metadatify introduces terminology that is used to describe concepts across the entire platform. It is recommended you become familiar with this terminology, as it is also used throughout this documentation. You can read more about the terminology [here](../Terminology).

## What Metadatify is

Metadatify stores **metadata**, providing references to the location of raw data. Metadatify indexes this metadata and provides an interface to organize, track, and search it. Metadatify provides a mechanism to generate tracking resources such as physical labels or digital metadata files.

## What Metadatify is **not**

Metadatify should _never_ store raw data, it does not function as a raw data storage platform. Metadatify is designed to be most effective for tracking data and managing metadata.
